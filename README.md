# MovieSoup 1.0

First working version 01.06.2021

A little app I made for myself using a Python library Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing and Tkinter for UI. Since I like catching my movies on TV, I was bored with going over TV guide every time I wanted to see some movie, so I just wanted to check if there was something which is currently on my watch list airing in the evening with few clicks. For now only a search by keywords is available, but I'll probably add search by channel and genre as well at some point. UI is in Serbian as it is covering Serbian movie channels.

Its fairly simple, just add words (or full movie names) you would want to search for and hit Претражи.

It's far from perfect (especially the UI), it was more of a side project and fun for me, and checking out how Python works as I've never dealth with it before.
