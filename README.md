# MovieSoup 1.0

First working version 01.06.2021

A little app I made for myself using a Python library Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing and Tkinter for UI. Since I like catching my movies on TV, I was bored with going over TV guide every time I wanted to see some movie, so I just wanted to check if there was something which is currently on my watch list airing in the evening with few clicks. 

UI is in Serbian as channels targeted are Serbian.

Search options available are as follows:

- By movie name (doesn't have to be exact, can pick movies with certain keyword). These keywords are saved to X:\Users\currentUser\MovieSoupSearch.txt in Windows, not sure where in Linux, but I know IO operation supports Linux as well. Keywords can be removed from the list by double clicking. The list is scrollable;
- By genre (relying on HTML and site for accuracy);
- By year the movie is produced (two fields, from and by).

Results list is scrollable.

In case you want to check Претражи is the Search button.

Still work in progress..
